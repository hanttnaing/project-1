          <div class="text-one"> Dear a ko Martin,</div>
          <p class="text-two">I'm probably going to deeply regret if I didn't tell<br>u before u study abroad.
            I know it's an awkward situation to tell because of our teacher & pupil relationship.
            If we put that aside for a moment, <br> we'r teenagers who'r just only 3yrs apart.<br>
      
            This may come as a surprise, but I wanna confess that...I've developed feelings 4 u. 
            I've been wanting to say this for a long time.
            But I've always pulled myself as I didn't want to make things awkward between us.

            This is my very first time confessing to someone I love. 
            And I know I shouldn't start opening up my feelings as a girl. 
            And I'm not asking u to return these feelings against your will. 
            U can openly give answer to my confession the way your heart goes. 
            I'm ready to accept both 'consideration' & 'rejection'.
